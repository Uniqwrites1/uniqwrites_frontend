# Password Length Limitation Fix

## Issue Overview

The backend API was returning an error `Index 70 out of bounds for length 70` when processing authentication requests. This typically occurs in Java-based backends when:

1. An array index is being accessed that is equal to the array length (Java arrays are 0-indexed, so valid indices are 0 to length-1)
2. Password processing might be using a fixed buffer size or algorithm with length restrictions

## Fix Implementation

We've implemented a client-side fix by truncating passwords that exceed 50 characters:

1. In `apiService.ts` login function:
   ```javascript
   password: password && password.length > 50 ? password.substring(0, 50) : password
   ```

2. In `apiService.ts` signup function:
   ```javascript
   password: userData.password && userData.password.length > 50 ? userData.password.substring(0, 50) : userData.password
   ```

3. In `authService.ts` resetPassword function:
   ```javascript
   const truncatedPassword = newPassword.length > 50 ? newPassword.substring(0, 50) : newPassword;
   ```

## Why This Works

The "Index 70 out of bounds for length 70" error suggests the backend is likely using a fixed-size array or buffer of 70 characters for password handling. By limiting passwords to 50 characters, we ensure they'll fit within this buffer.

## Security Considerations

This is a short-term fix to allow the application to function while backend issues are addressed. A properly designed authentication system should:

1. Allow long, complex passwords (at least 100+ characters)
2. Use secure hash algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 that handle arbitrary-length inputs
3. Not have fixed-length buffers for security-critical data

## Next Steps

1. Report this issue to the backend development team
2. Request an update to the backend password handling logic to support longer passwords
3. Once the backend fix is deployed, remove these client-side truncations
4. Update password requirements UI to inform users about any length restrictions

## Testing

After implementing this fix, test the following scenarios:

1. Login with a long password (60+ characters)
2. Signup with a long password
3. Password reset with a long new password

All should work without the "Index out of bounds" error.
