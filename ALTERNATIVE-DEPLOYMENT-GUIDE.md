# 🚀 Alternative Deployment Guide - GitHub Integration

Since we're experiencing network connectivity issues with npm/Vercel CLI, we'll use the GitHub integration method to deploy to Vercel.

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Deployment Process**

### **Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)**

#### **1. Connect Repository to Vercel:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up/login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository: `Uniqwrites1/uniqwrites_frontend`
5. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite/React project

#### **2. Configure Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard:**
Before deploying, add these environment variables in Vercel:
- Go to your project settings > Environment Variables
- Add the following variables:

```bash
# Required Environment Variables
GMAIL_USER=uniqwrites1@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=fbeiervfgrwzzsfr
VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/xkgrlnaq
```

#### **3. Deploy:**
1. Click "Deploy" in Vercel dashboard
2. Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application
3. Your site will be available at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### **Method 2: Manual ZIP Upload (Alternative)**

If GitHub integration doesn't work:

1. **Prepare Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create Deployment Package:**
   - Zip the entire project folder
   - Upload via Vercel dashboard > "Import from ZIP"

### **Method 3: Alternative CLI Installation**

If you want to try CLI again later with different network:

```bash
# Try using different registry
npm install -g vercel --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Or try Yarn instead
npm install -g yarn
yarn global add vercel

# Or use npx without global install
npx vercel@latest --prod
```

## 🔧 **Post-Deployment Configuration**

### **1. Verify Environment Variables:**
After deployment, check that all environment variables are properly set:
- `GMAIL_USER` - should be set to uniqwrites1@gmail.com
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` - should be set to the app password
- `VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` - should be set to the Formspree URL

### **2. Test Email Functionality:**
1. Visit your deployed site
2. Submit the contact form
3. Check if emails are being sent to uniqwrites1@gmail.com
4. Test both Vercel function and Formspree fallback

### **3. Custom Domain (Optional):**
If you have a domain:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard > Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed

## 📝 **Current Project Status:**

### **✅ Ready for Deployment:**
- All authentication removed
- Email service with dual approach (Vercel + Formspree)
- All 6 forms working with email integration
- Thank you page with form-specific messaging
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Clean, responsive design maintained
- Secret references removed from vercel.json

### **📁 Files Ready:**
- `vercel.json` - Configured for serverless functions
- `pages/api/send-email.ts` - Serverless email function
- All form components updated
- Environment variables template ready

### **🔄 Next Steps After Deployment:**
1. Test all 6 forms (contact, teacher, parent, school, volunteer, sponsor)
2. Verify email delivery to uniqwrites1@gmail.com
3. Check console for any errors
4. Test on mobile devices
5. Configure any additional domains if needed

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Environment Variables Don't Work:**
- Check they're set for both "Production" and "Preview" environments
- Restart the deployment after adding variables
- Check the function logs in Vercel dashboard

### **If Emails Don't Send:**
- Check Vercel function logs for errors
- Verify Gmail app password is correct
- Test Formspree form separately
- Check spam folder

### **If Build Fails:**
- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Verify no missing imports or files

**The application is fully ready for deployment!** 🎉

Use the GitHub integration method as it's the most reliable and doesn't require CLI installation.
